abstract: Debugger on Chip for a Multi-Processor System on Chip. A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a Multi-Core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These technologies meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security. A Debugger on Chip (DBG) is a Hardware-Software System that is used to test and debug Hardware Description Languages. The code to be examined is running on a simulator, a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered. When a hardware description crashes, debuggers show the position of the error in the target description.
