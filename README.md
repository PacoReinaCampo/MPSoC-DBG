**Implementation in VHDL & (System)Verilog of a Debugger on Chip and simulation in GHDL & Icarus Verilog**

A debugger (DBG) is a computer program that is used to test and debug hardware descriptions languages. The code to be examined is running on a simulator, a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered. When a hardware description crashes, debuggers show the position of the error in the target description.
